Behavioural Design Patterns:
    Behavioural design patterns are responsible for efficient communication and 
    the assignment of responsibilities among objects.
    They focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other,
     as well as how the flow of control is organized within a system.
    These patterns help in defining the protocols of communication between objects 
    and help in distributing responsibilities to ensure that the system
    is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

    Examples of behavioural design patterns include:
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor
