/*
  When we talk about numbers in TypeScript, we have to be aware of the different types of numbers that we can use.
  Like :
    1. Decimal (base 10) (integers and floating point numbers)
    2. Hexadecimal (base 16)
    3. Binary (base 2)
    4. Octal (base 8)

*/
var decimal = 10;
var hex = 0xf00d;
var binary = 10;
var octal = 484;
console.log(decimal);
console.log(hex);
console.log(binary);
console.log(octal);
