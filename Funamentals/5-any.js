/*
any is a type that represents any kind of value.
It is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript,
allowing you to gradually opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation.
if you don't know the type of a variable in advance,
you can use any to opt-out of type-checking.
if you don't specify a type, it will be considered as any by default.
